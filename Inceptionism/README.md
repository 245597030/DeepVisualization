Please feel free to modify the switches and paramters in `inceptionism_big.m` and see what happens. 

Some results are uploaded to [Baidu Photo](http://xiangce.baidu.com/picture/album/list/41344a5443cc313414de9559899e213417674a76).

Here is the figure displayed in my paper for comparison. The (c) rows are created by [Inceptionism](https://github.com/google/deepdream) , (d) rows's algorithm is similar with https://github.com/auduno/deepdraw and (e) rows are my results.
